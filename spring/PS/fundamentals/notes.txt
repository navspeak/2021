Entities: objects that live in DB
- Traditionally defined in persistence.xml
- spring boot uses entity scanning . Anything under main configuration class annotated with @SpringBoot or @EnableAllConfiguration is searched. Also @Entity
- @RestController = @Controller + @ResponseBody - can't return model for templating engine like thymeleaf. @ResponseBody serializes the return to Http Body
