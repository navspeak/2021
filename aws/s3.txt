Hardware assisted virtualization - for moving an EBS to a new AZ (not PV)
EBS Vol -> create Snapstop

You have an EC2 isntance and EBS vol in us-east1b. You want to move it to us-east-1c
Find root device Vol -> action -> create snapshot (myc2snap)
Under EBS > Snapshots > create an Image or vol
Create image > myec2image > all default but virtualization as HVM vs PV.HVM good for launching different Ec2

EBS = Virtual Hard Disk
Snapshots exst on S3 = photograph of the disk at apoint in time = snapshotsare incremental. So only delta of change sincelast snapshot move to s3
root device snapsot best practice to stop instance b4 taking snapshot
