To migrate file share configurations from your on-premises file system, you must migrate your files first to Amazon FSx
before migrating your file share configuration.

Migrate the existing file share configuration to AWS Storage Gateway is incorrect because AWS Storage Gateway is primarily
used to integrate your on-premises network to AWS but not for migrating your applications.
Using a file share in Storage Gateway implies that you will still keep your on-premises systems, and not entirely migrate it.

Review - q15 - secrets
17 - Take note that there are certain differences between CloudWatch and Enhanced Monitoring Metrics. CloudWatch gathers
metrics about CPU utilization from the hypervisor for a DB instance, and Enhanced Monitoring gathers its metrics from an agent on the instance.
As a result, you might find differences between the measurements, because the hypervisor layer performs a small amount of work.
Hence, enabling Enhanced Monitoring in RDS is the correct answer in this specific scenario.
