1. Only some EC2 instance type have ephemeral drive (instance store) attached to it. t2.micro - does not have.
 m5d.large has instance store

2. To access Instance drive, you have mount (to say D drive) & first instance drive.
 When m/c shuts down, the instance drive will be gone (D drive in this case). It is not lost when merely restarted.
as same vm continues to be used.. Just OS restarts

3. You can't attach EBS from different az.
   - You will need to mount and format only once

4. EBS Backup
use case:
- automatically take regular point-in-time backups from EBS volume and save on AWS S3
- backup should be optimized ti take the least s3 storage possible
- encrypt data at rest for backup files

* Snapshots are incremental. Deleting snapsots deletes fata unique to that snapshot only
* copy EBS snapshots across AZ & regions +  Restore to achieve HA
*
