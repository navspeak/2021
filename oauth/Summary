SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) — is a standard for securely exchanging user’s identity between SAML authority (called an identity provider or IdP)
and SAML consumer (called a service provider or SP). Thus defining 3 roles: the principal (user), identity provider and service provider. 
SAML eliminates passing passwords. Instead, it uses cryptography and digital signatures to pass a secure sign-in token from an identity provider to a service provider. 
Is one of the most widely used protocols when it comes to Single sign-on implementation.
